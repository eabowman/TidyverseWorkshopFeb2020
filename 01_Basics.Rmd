# Create a new project

We are going to create a new project in RStudio for this workshop on your desktop. Projects allow you to divide your data and scripts into multiple workflows.
1. Go to file.
2. Click 'New Project'.
3. Click 'New Directory'.
4. Click 'New Project'.
5. In 'Directory Name', type Tidyverse WS.
6. In 'Create project as a subdirectory of:', type ~/Desktop

Now if you look at your desktop, you will see a new folder which will include our new RSstudio project.

1. Variables make up the columns
2. Observations make up the rows.
3. Values go into cells. 


## Importance of consistency

# What is a data table?
