# TidyverseWorkshopFeb2020

## Objectives
  * Read data into RStudio
  * Explain the basics of tidyverse and what it is used for
  * Create summary statistics for a dataset
  * Restructure and manipulate datasets
  * Create a box and whisker plot
  * Create a scatter plot with a line of best fit

This is an introduction to tidyverse and is meant for people with no or limited knowledge of R and RStudio. This 1.5 hour workshop was taught at the University of Arizona Feb. 18, 2020. It was written by Elizabeth Bowman and modified from the DataCarpentry tutorial 'Data Manipulation usign dplyr and tidyr' (https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html) to fit the time frame and the audience.
